        The JSON formatted string contains the following information:

        The returned JSON object has the following structure:

        - **turnData** (*dict*): A dictionary where keys are turn numbers (e.g., "0", "1") and values are objects
          containing the analysis for that turn. The turn object contains the following fields:

            - **winrate** (*float*): The probability (0.0 to 1.0) of the selected player winning at the start of the turn.
            - **scoreLead** (*float*): The expected score difference for the selected player at the start of the turn.
            - **bestMove** (*str*): The optimal move suggested by the engine in GTP format (e.g., "C3", "pass").
            - **bestMoveScoreLead** (*float*): The expected score difference if the `bestMove` is played.
            - **nextPlayer** (*str*): The color of the player to move ('B' or 'W').
            - **classification** (*str*): A qualitative assessment of the move played (e.g., 'BEST', 'EXCELLENT', 'MISTAKE').

        - **scoreLeadList** (*list[float]*): An ordered list of score leads for black at each turn,
          suitable for plotting a score lead graph over the game.
